# PCB-to-AR
This project contains scripts, for Unity, that enable our PCB model next actions:
- rotation;
- scaling;
- moving;
- changing opacity.

By nature, it is an application similar to the [Tuziteljstvo](https://github.com/szaimovic1/Tuziteljstvo) project. The demo video, the app, and the Image Target can be found on [PCB-to-AR](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1492HIFPTcLf-P4BtxlAsD8hXt-AZmfXs?usp=sharing).
